Class for Java VS py File for Python

https://github.com/in28minutes/java-to-python-in-100-steps

Import as existing maven project


def keyword fot create a method

	def name_of_method():
		body_of_method...
		
FORMATING 4 spaces is very important


Passing parameter do not need to define type
Example

	def print_hello_world_multiple_times(times):
		for i in range (1,times+1):
			print("Hello world")

LOOP WITH RANGE		
range(start, stop, step)	
for in in range():


FORMATING STRING 
java
	System.out.printf("%d X %d = %d", table, i, table * i)
python
	print(f"{table} X {i} = {table*i}")
	
	
OVERLOADING METHODS	
In python it cannot be done.
Instead use default parameters
